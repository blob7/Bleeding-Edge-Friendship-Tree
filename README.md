## Description
### Nework Graph
THe Network Graph aims to show the complex web of connections that have formed over the many years that the Bleeding Edge players have spent together.  
### App
The app allows for mainting and updating the network graph in a live enviorment. 

### Purpose
As a player who has spent a long time in the community and made many friends and interacted with a vast amount of this tightly-nit community, I have often wondered how connected and close our community really is. To solve this question I developed this app where I could survey and record the connections between the players using data that the players in the community provides
