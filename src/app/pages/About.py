        of the community. Bleeding Edge has historically had a tight-knit community where word of mouth spreads quickly.
        It has also witnessed the formation of 'factions' and the drama between them. This project aims to showcase the
        complex ways in which our community is connected. Data is collected by surveying community members, and
        connections are at the discretion of the individuals involved, meaning some relationships can be one-way. If any
